This is because round defaults to producing a value to the nearest whole number. However, we can override the default inputing a second argument. You are not expected to memorize all arguments of every function you learn during this course. If you have R locally installed, you can run a ? in front of the function name in your console to pull up a help file that will define the arguments of a function for you. These help files can also be found on line. For example, here is the help file for round here\nFrom the documentation, you can see the second argument of the function round is digits.\nYour Turn Change the 0 to another number, and take note on how this changes the corresponding output when you click Run Code.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nround(3.22, digits = 1)\n\n[1] 3.2\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you may notice, the first argument and second argument are separated by a ,.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hello, in this video we’re going to talk about the specifics and syntax of visualizing data with the ggplot2 package and we’re going to do so using data on penguins!\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick reminder that ggplot2 is tidyverse’s data visualization package\n\n\nThe structure of ggplot2 code looks almost always is the same: we start with the ggplot function where the first argument is the data that you want to plot and the second argument defines the aesthetic mappings using the aes function – in this template we have only defined the x and y aesthetics, for example. This one is somewhat unusual, you’re passing a function, aes, as the argument of another function, ggplot. You’ll see more of this as we progress through the course, though more often you’ll see data frame or variable names being passed to function arguments. and then we add on another layer – a geom layer – which defines the geometric shapes with which you want to represent your data and then optionally, though in many cases are recommendedly, we add further layers to the plot to make our plot a little bit easier to read, a little bit easier to glean information from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data that we’re working with is called penguins. It comes from the palmerpenguins package, and we also need the tidyverse package for our analyses.\n\n\nSo let’s load those packages first And then glimpse at the data. glimpse is a function that prints out the variables in the data frame, their types – which we’ll dig deeper into later in the course –, and the first few observations as comma separated values.\n\n\nThe data contains body measurements on three species of penguins, chinstrap, gentoo, and adelie. The bodu measurements include things like bill length and depth, flipper length, and body mass. We also know which island the penguin is on, their sec, and the year of data collection. There are a total of 8 columns, so 8 variables.\nThe output also shows that we have 344 rows, that is, we have data on 344 penguins.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shown here is our final goal. We’ll plot bill length against bill depth, both measured in millimeters. We’ll represent each penguin with a point, colored by their species. The species mappings are summarized in the legend of the plot. The plot also has a title, a subtitle, and a caption.\n–&gt; [other tab] And the code for the plot is shown here. It looks like what we’ve seen before – ggplot function to start with, then the data, the aesthetic mappings, the geom, and some other layers for labels and color palette. This is a lot of code at once though, so let’s unpack it layer by layer.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, let’s code out loud!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe start with the ggplot function and indicate that we want to plot the penguins data frame. As a result, we get an empty canvas that we can paint our data on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThem we map bill depth to the x-axis &gt;&gt; we can see the x-axis indicates the variable name, its range, and a reasonable breakpoint\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we map bill length to the y-axis &gt;&gt; we can see the y-axis mapped as well\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally &gt;&gt; we add a geom layer – a geom point, indicating that the data should be represented as points. There seems to be three clusters of points here, let’s see what happens if we also ask that the points be colored by species.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this requires mapping another variable to a new aesthetic of the plot, we do this in the aesthetic mappings &gt;&gt; mapping color to species. Note that not only the points are colored, but we also gained a legend describing the mappings – red points represent Adelie penguins, green Chinstrap, blue Gentoo.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the data we want to see on our plot is there, let’s add some labels.\n\n\nLet’s set the title to Bill depth and length. Not a particularly informative title, but it’s a good starting point. We do this in the labs function, passing it to the title argument as a character string denoted with quotes. You can use double or single quotes in R, sticking to the tidyverse style guide we’ll use double quotes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s also add a subtitle\n\n\nAgain in the labs function, passing it to the subtitle argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd let’s fix up the x and y axis labels.\n\n\nBy default ggplot2 will use the variable names, but we can overwrite them by updating the x and y label of the plot, and using more human-friendly text like bill depth mm and bill length mm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally let’s relabel the legend as well\n\n\nWe do this also in the labs function, passing the desired label to the color argument. Note that the name of the argument matches the aesthetic mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally in the labels\n\n\nlet’s add a caption for the data source. This automatically gets placed below the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd before we finish up our plot we need to do one more thing – use a discrete color scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of color blindness.\n\n\nWe do this in a new layer, a scale layer, using a pre-defined color palette called viridis. The underscore-d denotes we will use the discrete color scale in this palette. If you have red-green color vision deficiency up until this point some of the points on the plot may have been difficult to tell apart. The goal with this palette is to make sure all, or at least more, viewers can see the points as intended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it altogether we have our code\n–&gt; The resulting plot –&gt; And the narrative we built with each layer of the plot\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we wrap up this introduction to ggplot2, one quick note about argument names. It’s common in R to omit the names of the first two arguments. In the ggplot function\n\n\nthese are data and mapping So you’ll commonly see me and others write ggplot code in the second way, omitting these argument names from the code."

    "text": "Please see (link webR activity) for a guide on how to interact with the different question types for the following activity.\n\n\nWe’ll use: tidyverse for majority of the activity and scales for pretty plot labels. These are ready to use for you in this activity!\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'gridExtra'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    combine\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use the iris dataset for this activity. This dataset is pre-packaged for you to use in R (Fisher 1936).\nThe iris dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). A sepal is the outer parts of the flower (often green and leaf-like) that enclose a developing bud. The petal are parts of a flower that are the pollen producing part of the flower that are often conspicuously colored. The data were collected in 1936 at the Gaspé Peninsula, in Canada. The difference between sepals and petals can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s first take a glimpse of our data set to become more familiar.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHow many rows and columns do we have in our dataset?\nAnswer: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 5 columns and 150 rows in the iris dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s explore the variable Petal.Length. Add the following correct geom to make side-by-side boxplots of Petal.Length for each Species.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nadd geom_boxplot() to the following code above to create side-by-side boxplots of Petal.Length for each Species\n\n\n\nThe code below takes your existing code, and colors each boxplot by Species using fill =. Change the fill to color. What happens? Why?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnswer: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nfill = fills in or changes the entire boxplot with color. color = changes the outline of your specific geom. The exception to this rule is the default shape for geom_point, where the default shape used for a scatterplot is a solid circle that will be filled in regardless if color or fill is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can layer more than one geom on your plot. Add an additional layer to your code to create the following plot seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nA + sign needs to go after geom_boxplot to signify an additional layer of the ggplot. We can use geom_point() to recreate the plot above.\n\n\n\nNow, instead of using geom_point, use geom_jitter. How does the plot change? What is the difference between geom_point and geom_jitter?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe points are now more spread out on each of the three boxplots. geom_jitter jitters our observations adding a small amount of random noise to data. It is used to spread out points that would otherwise overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny professional plot must have informative titles and labels. This can be accomplished using the labs function in R. Please add the following text to the plot:\nTitle: Petal Length for each Species\nY-axis: Petal Length in cm\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\niris |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Length, fill = Species)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  geom_jitter() + \n  labs(\n  title = \"Petal Length for each Species\",\n  y = \"Petal Length in cm\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use themes to continue to make plots more professional looking. Themes control all non-data aesthetics of our plot (e.g., plot background color). There are many themes in R to choose from. A a lit of themes can be found here .\nExplore the theme reference page and layer the following themes onto your plot:\n– theme_bw\n– theme_light\n– theme_minimal\nDocument what and what does not change.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotes: \n\n\n\n\n\nPick two variables (or more) from the iris dataset and make a visualization to visualize the relationship between the two variables. Along with your code and output, practice describing the relationship between your variables.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotes: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\niris |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n  title = \"Petal Length and Width by Species\",\n  y = \"Petal Length in cm\",\n  x = \"Petal Width in cm\"\n) + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between petal length and width is strong, positive and linear for each of the three species in the iris data set. It appears that the species virginica has the largest petals while setosa has the smallest."
