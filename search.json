    "text": "WebR is a version of the statistical language R compiled for the browser. We have created WebR documents for each programming activity you will interact with for each module.\nActivities are meant to provide an interactive environment for students to implement what they have learned from the videos. This activity allows you to write and run R-Code within the html document. Code chunks that allow you to do this look like:\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nRecall that anything after the # sign in a code chunk is treated as text, and not code.\nSometimes, we provide code chunks that are not interactive and will have already run for you. These will look like this:\n\n# example r-chunk\n\nThere will be a variety of question types throughout an activity. Question types include the following:\n– Your Turn: These coding questions ask students to add to existing code to produce output. These questions are followed with an Solution box so students can get immediate feedback\n– Demo: These coding questions have complete code within the chunks, and ask students to either think critically about the about, or slightly modify the existing code to learn more about the function!\nThroughout the activity, you will see open text boxes. These text boxes will either be labeled Answer or Notes.\n  - Answer: This prompts you to answer a short-answer question. These questions are followed by \n  a `Solutions` tab to reveal the answer.\n  \n  - Notes: This provides a space to take notes to be referenced later. These are often gives \n  after `Demo` questions. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving Your Work\n\n\n\nYour work does not automatically save.\nFor most browsers, the most efficient way to save your work is by using the Print feature. This may be useful if you want to come back and reference your work after it’s completed.\n– Right click anywhere on this html page\n– Select Print...\n– Under the Destination tab, click Save as PDF\n– Select a file on your computer you wish to save your work.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll use the tidyverse package in every programming activity. The tidyverse is an R package that has many different data science functions to help us better explore and visualize data. We need to “unpack” the package to use the functions inside. We do this with the following code.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nYou will see code for packages at the start of every programming activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Turn: First, let’s get started by using R as a calculator. Below, perform the following calculations by typing the equation into the code chunk and clicking Run Code\n– 2 + 2\n– 3 * 5\n– 10 / 2\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 + 2 \n\n[1] 4\n\n3 * 5 \n\n[1] 15\n\n10 / 2\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR is a functional language. Functions act as the name of algorithmic details that are used to accomplish a specific task. For example, if I wanted to round the value 3.23, I could accomplish this with the function round in R. The number 3.23 is an argument to the function round. An argument is an input to a function. A value is produced as a result.\nex.\n\nround(3.22)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nOften times, functions can take on multiple arguments. Previously, we saw round(3.225) produce the value 3. This is because round defaults to producing a value to the nearest whole number. However, we can override the default inputing a second argument. You are not expected to memorize all arguments of every function you learn during this course. If you have R locally installed, you can run a ? in front of the function name in your console to pull up a help file that will define the arguments of a function for you. These help files can also be found on line. For example, here is the help file for round here\nFrom the documentation, you can see the second argument of the function round is digits.\nYour Turn Change the 0 to another number, and take note on how this changes the corresponding output when you click Run Code.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nround(3.22, digits = 1)\n\n[1] 3.2\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you may notice, the first argument and second argument are separated by a ,. This is consistent across all functions in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined in the help file, you do not have to include the name of the argument\n\n\n\nround(3.225, 1)\n\n[1] 3.2\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the remainder of this activity, we are going to practice using fucntions on the mtcars data set. These data were extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).\nDemo Run the following code to see the first six lines of data below\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhat is the name of the function used in the above code? What is the input?\nAnswer: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe function is named head\nThe argument is the dataset mtcars\n\n\n\nWe can also get a better sense of the data we are working with by using the glimpe function. This allows us to see how many rows and columns we have in our data set, the type of data we are working with, and the data inputs. For now, we just want to practice writing the function to initially explore these data.\nYour Turn Use the glimpse function on the mtcars data set below.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nHow many rows are in the mtcars data set?

    "text": "Hello, in this video we’re going to talk about the specifics and syntax of visualizing data with the ggplot2 package and we’re going to do so using data on penguins!\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick reminder that ggplot2 is tidyverse’s data visualization package\n\n\nThe structure of ggplot2 code looks almost always is the same: we start with the ggplot function where the first argument is the data that you want to plot and the second argument defines the aesthetic mappings using the aes function – in this template we have only defined the x and y aesthetics, for example. This one is somewhat unusual, you’re passing a function, aes, as the argument of another function, ggplot. You’ll see more of this as we progress through the course, though more often you’ll see data frame or variable names being passed to function arguments. and then we add on another layer – a geom layer – which defines the geometric shapes with which you want to represent your data and then optionally, though in many cases are recommendedly, we add further layers to the plot to make our plot a little bit easier to read, a little bit easier to glean information from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data that we’re working with is called penguins. It comes from the palmerpenguins package, and we also need the tidyverse package for our analyses.\n\n\nSo let’s load those packages first And then glimpse at the data. glimpse is a function that prints out the variables in the data frame, their types – which we’ll dig deeper into later in the course –, and the first few observations as comma separated values.\n\n\nThe data contains body measurements on three species of penguins, chinstrap, gentoo, and adelie. The bodu measurements include things like bill length and depth, flipper length, and body mass. We also know which island the penguin is on, their sec, and the year of data collection. There are a total of 8 columns, so 8 variables.\nThe output also shows that we have 344 rows, that is, we have data on 344 penguins.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shown here is our final goal. We’ll plot bill length against bill depth, both measured in millimeters. We’ll represent each penguin with a point, colored by their species. The species mappings are summarized in the legend of the plot. The plot also has a title, a subtitle, and a caption.\n–&gt; [other tab] And the code for the plot is shown here. It looks like what we’ve seen before – ggplot function to start with, then the data, the aesthetic mappings, the geom, and some other layers for labels and color palette. This is a lot of code at once though, so let’s unpack it layer by layer.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, let’s code out loud!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe start with the ggplot function and indicate that we want to plot the penguins data frame. As a result, we get an empty canvas that we can paint our data on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThem we map bill depth to the x-axis &gt;&gt; we can see the x-axis indicates the variable name, its range, and a reasonable breakpoint\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we map bill length to the y-axis &gt;&gt; we can see the y-axis mapped as well\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally &gt;&gt; we add a geom layer – a geom point, indicating that the data should be represented as points. There seems to be three clusters of points here, let’s see what happens if we also ask that the points be colored by species.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this requires mapping another variable to a new aesthetic of the plot, we do this in the aesthetic mappings &gt;&gt; mapping color to species. Note that not only the points are colored, but we also gained a legend describing the mappings – red points represent Adelie penguins, green Chinstrap, blue Gentoo.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the data we want to see on our plot is there, let’s add some labels.\n\n\nLet’s set the title to Bill depth and length. Not a particularly informative title, but it’s a good starting point. We do this in the labs function, passing it to the title argument as a character string denoted with quotes. You can use double or single quotes in R, sticking to the tidyverse style guide we’ll use double quotes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s also add a subtitle\n\n\nAgain in the labs function, passing it to the subtitle argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd let’s fix up the x and y axis labels.\n\n\nBy default ggplot2 will use the variable names, but we can overwrite them by updating the x and y label of the plot, and using more human-friendly text like bill depth mm and bill length mm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally let’s relabel the legend as well\n\n\nWe do this also in the labs function, passing the desired label to the color argument. Note that the name of the argument matches the aesthetic mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally in the labels\n\n\nlet’s add a caption for the data source. This automatically gets placed below the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd before we finish up our plot we need to do one more thing – use a discrete color scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of color blindness.\n\n\nWe do this in a new layer, a scale layer, using a pre-defined color palette called viridis. The underscore-d denotes we will use the discrete color scale in this palette. If you have red-green color vision deficiency up until this point some of the points on the plot may have been difficult to tell apart. The goal with this palette is to make sure all, or at least more, viewers can see the points as intended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it altogether we have our code\n–&gt; The resulting plot –&gt; And the narrative we built with each layer of the plot\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we wrap up this introduction to ggplot2, one quick note about argument names. It’s common in R to omit the names of the first two arguments. In the ggplot function\n\n\nthese are data and mapping So you’ll commonly see me and others write ggplot code in the second way, omitting these argument names from the code."
